title:  "Diabetes, Dieting and Indian Festivities"
---

Ever since I was diagnosed, dieting has always been a question for which I continuously strive to find an answer. "What should I eat?", "Should I cut down carbs altogether?", or perhaps most importantly, "Is there something specific I must eat to *undo* my diabetes?" (the answer obviously being no to this one!) are some boggling questions that buzzed in my mind initially.

I overcame the initial layer of skepticism by understanding that *there's absolutely no food I need to avoid!* I learnt how to count my carbs and dose insulin by keeping in mind other external factors. (to be described in other articles) [Your Diabetes Insider](https://www.youtube.com/@yourdiabetesinsider) and [Type One Talks](https://www.youtube.com/@TypeOneTalks) are two absolutely fantastic channels handled by diabetics who give advice on the same. [The Glucose Goddess](https://www.youtube.com/@GlucoseRevolution) (Jessie Inchausp√©) suggests 10 dieting tweaks which you can accomodate in your everyday meals for a healthier relationship with sugar levels, although this is not from the viewpoint of an insulin dependent person.

The greatest challenge in dealing with dieting and diabetes is in keeping up with societal expectations. Coming from an Indian  household, the array of festivals throughout the year comes along with an enticing variety of carb-heavy foods. Most occasions demand the preparation of foods such as *vada* (deep fried lentil and rice donuts), *chakkara pongal* (boiled rice with jaggery syrup), *payasam* (rice/semolina milk pudding with sugar) and so on. An added disadvantage is the common *elai sapadu* which consists of a feast of dishes served on a plantain leaf. This feast often comes along with a massive sugar spike from each item, along with the carb-heavy items served first which act contradictory to my interests.

I deal with my sugars during such times by incorporating the following practices:
1. I begin my day with *exercise*. (My exercise regime will be described in another article) This boosts insulin sensitivity for the whole day and I'm geared up for all kinds of high sugar challenges.
2. I make sure to stick to my order of meals (fibre, protein, complex carbs and simple carbs) despite the one being served. I feel full post meal and this order is more gentle on the spike.
3. I don't eat plain carbs for any meal. If situation forces me to do so, I dose first, wait for 15 minutes and eat after. This reduces the spike, although not significantly.
4. I keep portion control in mind. Keeping tab of portion is included in carb counting. Knowing how much I eat enforces control over the amount of food subconsciously at this helps.
5. I DO NOT SKIP any meals. There's no "let me skip this meal because the next one will be heavy" kinda deal. This leads to a huge dip and rise in sugar levels which becomes uncontrollably difficult to manage.
