title:  "Diabetes and Menstruation"
---

Menstruation can be a massive tribulation for what it is, and diabetes tends to make it worse. I usually face struggles with cramps almost every month, irrespective of the kind of lifestyle I follow. Nevertheless, keeping tab on certain things and taking help from loved ones has made periods so much more bearable.

------------

Typically, the challenges I face during that time of the month are:

1. My sugars spike a few days before I'm due. Apart from the mood swings that's commonly talked about, I feel extra tired and less motivated to maintain sugars.

2. The first day of bleeding leads to a heavy drop in sugars. Additionally, I have cramps and digestive issues, which lead to turbulent few hours. I'm sometimes stuck in a cycle of low sugar -> food -> bad digestion -> low sugar.

------------

The best ways for me to deal with these are a mixture of diet and insulin regulations. Of course, it begins with keeping track of my menstruation cycles and knowing when I'm due.

1. I increase my carb-to-insulin ratio by half unit right before my period to deal with high cortisol levels. I reduce it back to normal, or half unit lesser the day I'm due. This helps my body adjust to all metabolic changes smoothly.

2. Honestly, I give in to food cravings in a healthy manner. A couple of meals with dark chocolate or warm noodle soup does no harm and is soul nourishing!

3. I take a break from all kinds of exercise for a few days. I just really think I deserve the rest until I'm recharged again. I spend my time dedicated to workout by watching Netflix instead :)

4. If my sugars go severely low, I reduce my long-acting insulin as well. This is also done if I am exposed to any severe weather such as hot summers or chilly winters at that time, as my body takes up energy to stay regulated.

5. Exercising and eating fibre rich foods, as much as possible during other times of the month helps me prepare for what comes ahead.
