Here are some relevant links describing some of my recent projects: <br>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19816" target="_blank">A Formal Analysis of Algorithms for Matroids and Greedoids: </a>This project involves the study and formalization (using <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/" target="_blank">Isabelle/HOL</a>) of algorithms for matroids and greedoids, with the certain results of the former and the latter being done for the first time in any theorem prover.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/25shriya/Introduction-to-Greedoids" target="_blank">Introduction to Greedoids:</a> This repository contains the report and formalization (using Isabelle/HOL) submitted as part of my postgraduate dissertation at King's College London.</li>
    <li><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2024/projects/kcmBd7yA" target="_blank">Google Summer of Code 2024:</a> I had the opportunity to participate in this summer project and contribute to the open source mathematical software system, <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/" target="_blank">SageMath</a>. I created a custom class for Chow rings of matroids using Python programming and wrote code for their Gr√∂bner basis and monomial basis as well.</li>
    <li><a href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/vector_partition.html" target="_blank">Vector Partitions Module, SageMath:</a> I developed the functionalities of the vector partitions module in SageMath as part of my study on vector partitions toward my undergraduate dissertation.</li>
    <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9673261" target="_blank">Mathematical Blood Flow: Simulations and Data Analysis: </a>I worked on a project which modeled the human cardiovascular system (as a Newtonian fluid) and computed the wall shear stress and volumetric flow rate of blood (using Homotopy Analysis Method) for males and females of ages ranging from 19 to 60. My predominant role in this project was analyzing the data obtained by clustering and further plotting regression models to understand the relationship between the independent and dependant variables, which resulted in the publication of given conference paper. Subsequently, a similar research was done for anaemic and polycythaemic patients, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-9906-2_34" target="_blank">published</a>  in Springer Nature Link.<li>
</ul>
