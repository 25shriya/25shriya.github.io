I am a mathematician with training in algebra, geometry and number theory. Additionally, I have experience in studying combinatorial geometries
in algebraic geometry and optimization.
<br> <br>
I obtained my MSc in Mathematics degree from King's College London, prior to which I did a 4 year MSc in
Mathematics at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. My CV can be made available upon request.

<br> <br>
I have keen interests in formalization of math, Python and SageMath programming.
I'm also an avid musician by the side and I enjoy recording stuff on my piano from time to time.

Feel free to reach out to me if any of the above interest you!
