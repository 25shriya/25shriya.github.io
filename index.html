  Welcome to my homepage!
</p>

I am a mathematician with training in algebra, geometry and number theory. Additionally, I have experience in studying combinatorial geometries
in algebraic geometry and optimization. I have keen interests in formalization of math, Python and SageMath programming! 

I'm an avid musician by the side and I enjoy recording stuff on my piano from time to time!

Thanks for reading!
