    <p>
        I am a mathematician with training in algebra, geometry and number theory. Additionally, I have experience in studying matroids
        in the context of algebraic geometry and combinatorial optimization.
        <br> <br>
        I obtained my MSc in Mathematics degree from King's College London, prior to which I did a 4 year MSc in
        Mathematics at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. My CV can be made available upon request.<sup><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></sup>

        <br> <br>
        I have keen interests in formalization of math, Python and SageMath programming.
        I'm also an avid musician by the side and I enjoy recording stuff on my piano from time to time.
